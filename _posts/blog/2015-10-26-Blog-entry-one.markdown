   Even, if only I read this post, it would be nice to introduce myself. So Hi, my name is Rafa≈Ç and I'm a software programmer. English isn't my native luangage so, if somebody reads it, please cut me some slack. I have a Bachelor of Engineering in comptuter sience and currently going on a road to get my Master degree. I also work as a Unity3D developer in company called Aidem-media, making games for iOS devices.<br>
  It's fairly to say, that besides being a gamer, I'm a games development nerd, devouring every subject concerning this industry. Right now I'm particularly interested in real-time 3D computer graphics rendering.
  In order to enhance self-development, I've decided to start writing this blog. I'll be mostly taking up tech subjects concerning my interests, so you can expect games development, graphics programming, software developing and specific tech problems. <br>
  Content on this blog will be dedicated mostly for programmers. I don't hide the fact, that the purpose of this blog is to help me establish knowledge, in previously mentioned fields, but if anybody will read my scribble and learn anything from it, I'll be even more than happy.
